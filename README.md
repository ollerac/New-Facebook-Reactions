Facebook Reactions
------------------

A chrome plugin that adds some awesome new emotive buttons to Facebook.

Why you should use this plugin:
===============================

- You get 12 brand new ways to quickly express your emotional reactions to facebook posts
	- dislike
	- hate
	- love
	- threaten
	- applaud
	- stare creepily
	- accuse of racism
	- offer bribe 
	- express doubt
	- incite rebellion
	- pass joint
	- throw tomato

- It works on the following pages
	- the homepage newsfeed
	- profiles
	- the newsfeeds for friend lists
	- pages
	- events pages
	- groups pages
- It auto-expands all your comments 



Why you shouldn't use this plugin:
==================================
- Facebook is *constantly* changing their front-end code (even when the design isn't changing), so this plugin could break at any time
- It won't let you add reactions to stories with more than 300 comments (stories with a 100,000 likes and 10,000 comments were causing a lot of lag)
- It auto-expands all your comments 
- It might have some bugs
- It doesn't let you remove a reaction you added with it (yet! that's version 2.0!)



The emoticons that people will see if they don't have the plugin installed:
===========================================================================
- dislike              (>_<)
- hate                 ヽ(#`Д´)ﾉ
- love                 -`❤´-
- threaten             ╰(◣﹏◢)╯
- applaud              ヽ(´▽`)/
- stare creepily       (⊙_⊙)
- accuse of racism     (;`・´)>
- offer bribe          (•_-)ﾉ$
- express doubt        ఠ_ಠ
- incite rebellion     ＼(｀0´)／
- pass joint           ~(‾⌣‾~)
- throw tomato         (｀д´)ノ
